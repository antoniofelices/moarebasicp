# Functions WP

Some functions Studio Moare use to create a websites base on WordPress. Basically: custom post types, custom fields and google analytics.

## Axiom

On functions.php you should write all your theme functions. If you turn off your theme, these functions won't work.

Therefore declare somethings like google analytics or your custom post types on functions.php is not a good idea. Instead is better to have a simple plugin to do that.
